🚀 Features
Nutrient-Based Recommendations:
Select nutrients like Calories, Protein, Fat, etc., and choose desired levels (Low, Medium, High, Very High).

The model predicts and recommends top matching recipes using Logistic Regression.

Keyword-Based Recommendations:
Enter phrases like "spicy chicken low carb" and receive personalized recipe suggestions using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity.

Review Visualizations:
Explore interactive charts on user reviews, including:

Rating distributions.

Review trends over the years.

Average ratings by year.

Top reviewers.

Recipe Data Visualizations:
Pre-generated insightful plots:

Top recipe categories.

Nutrient correlation heatmaps.

Common ingredients.

Average cook times by category.

📊 Model Integration and Evaluation
Logistic Regression is used for nutrient-level classification to recommend relevant recipes.

Fallback Strategy: If no exact nutrient matches are found, the model suggests recipes based on probability scores for best alternatives.

Keyword Matching: Utilizes TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for effective text-based recommendations.
