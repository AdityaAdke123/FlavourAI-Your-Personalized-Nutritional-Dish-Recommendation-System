## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Nutrient-Based Recommendations:
- Select nutrients like **Calories**, **Protein**, **Fat**, etc., and choose desired levels (**Low**, **Medium**, **High**, **Very High**).
- The model predicts and recommends top matching recipes using **Logistic Regression**.

### 🔹 Keyword-Based Recommendations:
- Enter phrases like _"spicy chicken low carb"_ and receive personalized recipe suggestions using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.

### 🔹 Review Visualizations:
Explore interactive charts on user reviews, including:
- Rating distributions.
- Review trends over the years.
- Average ratings by year.
- Top reviewers.

### 🔹 Recipe Data Visualizations:
Pre-generated insightful plots:
- Top recipe categories.
- Nutrient correlation heatmaps.
- Common ingredients.
- Average cook times by category.
